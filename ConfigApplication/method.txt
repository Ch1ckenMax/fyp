Function 1: Easy modification of parameters
- Find a way for the host machine to write on the target machine's memory
    - Allocate memory space for the config
    - OpenOCD? STProgrammer? STLINK? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cleO3mHjWw 
- Host machine: YAML config file that matches with the parameters required by the target machine => upload to target machine with specific syntax => target machine reads upon restart
- Target machine: parser that reads the parameters carefully at startup

Function 2: Calibration
- Find a way to connect host to memory in REAL time
- Perhaps just use SVW log and parse something? Serial?
- Client reads the sensor values, record, and change the YAML file, and upload it back
    - Graphical demonstration (min max throttle, deadzone settings etc.)

Function 3: Logging
- Check the sVW logs in real time
